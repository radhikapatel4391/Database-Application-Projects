To use this project in eclipse, you need to add serlvet-api.jar
to the Build Path as an "external JAR". Just browse to your
tomcat-8.5/lib directory and find it there.

Alternatively, use "Open Projects from File System...", then Directory, and
choose the servlet1 directory. Then add servlet-api.jar to the project
as above.
