I want to user 1 day for late submission.



Note: to run this project with HSQLDB (easiest way):
1. Start the HSQLDB server as explained in JdbcCheckup.java or use
   "ant start-hsqldb" after cd'ing to the database directory here. Let it hang.
   Create a new window to proceed.
   
2. Use "ant load-hsqldb" (still in database directory)
   
3. Use "ant hsqlSysTest" when cd'd to this directory. Also use runAdminApp and runUserApp to run their apps. 

To use a real DB: you need to define environment variables as discussed in build.xml
  For Oracle database, set up env variables ORACLE_USER, ORACLE_PW, ORACLE_SITE
  For MySQL use, set up env vars MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PW, MYSQL_SITE
See docs linked from the class web page for details.
