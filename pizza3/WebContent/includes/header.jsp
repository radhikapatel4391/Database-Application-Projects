<%-- Note: we can't usefully put the page directive with the desired character
    encoding (UTF-8) here in this file even though we want the same one in all 
    pages because the JSP spec says "Only the character encoding specified for 
    the requested page is used; the encodings of files included via the include 
    directive are not taken into consideration." (JSP.4.2 Response Char Encoding)
    JSP will generate a HTML <meta> tag for UTF-8 from this info.
