Thanks to Saaid Baraty for the solid basis for the pizza1 solution.
Edited by Betty O'Neil mainly to simplify the implementation.
Note: to run this project on UNIX/Linux with HSQLDB (easiest way):
1. Start the HSQLDB server as explained in JdbcCheckup.java or use
   "ant start-hsqldb" after cd'ing to the database directory here.
   then "ant load-hsqldb"
   
2. Use "ant hsqlSysTest" when cd'd to this directory

To use a real DB: you need to define environment variables as discussed in build.xml
 For Oracle database, set up env variables ORACLE_USER, ORACLE_PW, ORACLE_SITE
  For MySQL use, set up env vars MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PW, MYSQL_SITE
For Linux at cs.umb.edu, put these lines in your .profile:
# change these to fit your accounts--
export ORACLE_USER=xxxx
export ORACLE_PW=xxxx
export ORACLE_SITE=dbs2.cs.umb.edu:1521:dbs2
export MYSQL_USER=xxxx
export MYSQL_PW=xxxx
export MYSQL_SITE=topcat.cs.umb.edu
